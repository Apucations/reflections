1) adding new commits to the repository online, in github.


2)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  when you are going to work with more people in a projyect.
  
  
3)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  because not always you want to update what you have done in your pc.
